This project involves using a Markdown template repository to create a
collaborative get-to-know-you repository for a study group. Each member will
contribute one markdown file to the repository, and the emphasis is on fostering
group cohesion and practicing collaboration within a shared repository. The
process includes scheduling a meeting to organize the project and creating an
issue in the class repository with specific labels and details for tracking
progress.
